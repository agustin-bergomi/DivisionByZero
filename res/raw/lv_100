// we may also change default map settings such as creep drop off
// and creep destination...
// first 2 numbers are drop off
// second 2 are destination
// x then y of course
//5
//0
//^ sets start to be grid coordinates (5, 0)
//0
//12
//^ sets destination to be grid coordinates (0, 12)

// this is how spawns will be set...
// first s denotes a spawn command followed by a space
// all subsequent arguments will be seperated by a space
// the first argument is the image number/ sprite type (refer to sprite sheet)
// the second argument is the number of sprites to spawn
// the third number is the spawn rate (the higher the number the slower the spawn rate)
// the fourth is the movement speed modifier (expressed in GIRD_LENGTH)
// the fifth is the hp of the sprites
// the sixth is the gold reward of the sprites
// the seventh is a boolean of whether it's a sub-wave
//
// here is a sample:
// s 1 10 20 1 1 10     0 
//   t nu sr m h reward toggle if next wave is consecutive
//   y mb    s p
//   p er sp
//   e    aw
//        n 
//        ra
//        te
